                <p class="lead">I was 12 years old and I loved playing with computers downloading random stuff, trying new programs, manipulating system settings.
                I found a voice program called <strong class="color-aqua">TeamSpeak</strong>. The program required for you to connect to a server
                in order to communicate with other people on the internet.</p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    I was curious on how to setup a server. The servers world was unknown to me. I followed some tutorial videos. And got my first local <strong class="color-aqua">TeamSpeak</strong> server working!
                    I was super happy when I got it working. And started to create channels, modifying permissions, etc...
                    <br> <br>
                    Then I tried to add more interactive stuff to the server. And accidently followed a tutorial about <strong class="color-blue">Microsoft Visual Basic 2010</strong>.
                    I was confused of the program. I tried to write channel names instead of actual code ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . I thought the program is useless and didn't use it and went on my life.
                    <br> <br>
                    One day I went to the library with my family. And I found a book called "<strong class="color-pink">Microsoft Visual Studio 2012</strong>".
                    I saw that I had a similiar program on my computer. Which I thought it was useless. I bought the book and started reading it!
                    I saw some confusing concepts such as objects, variables, forms, classes and others. And I tried all of them and starting to make pattern out of them.
                    <br> <br>
                    But after understanding these concepts I realized that's how programming is in general. We just don't see it infront of us.
                    <br> <br>
                    Finally, After reading a lot from the book I was fascinated at how programming works and loved it!.
                    This is picture of the first program I ever made! It's very simple one but I applied everything I knew at the time on it.
                    I was really happy that I shared a video of me explaining it to my classmates.
