            Hello, My real name is Hamza. People on the internet call me "HD" or "Dev".
            I'm game and full stack developer.
            <br />
            I have been programming for 6 years since Grade 6! And, I know about 10 programming languages.

            I love creating games that people enjoy playing.
            <br />
            My favourite type of games is Multiplyer games. I'm fascinated in designing the game protocol.
            And, how the server apply rules to all the players to apply fairness in the game.
            <br>
            I like manipulating a game protocol to generate unexpected different game behaviour.
